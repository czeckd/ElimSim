# ElimSim

This is a simulator that plays elimination games of the type popular on Doctor 
Who forums such as [Gallifrey Base](http://gallifreybase.com/). 

Elimination games begin with a list of stories and then each player adds 1 point 
to one story and subtracts 2 points from a different story. Game play typically 
limits a player's turn to once per day.
